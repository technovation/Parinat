The most interesting aspect of making a humanoid is that it gives a great insight into the way our body functions while performing any kind of motion in terms of stability and actuation.\r\n\r\nParinat – sanskrit for Transform – Inspired by an ideological mashup of the movies “Transformers” and “Real Steel”, for the first version, we’re aiming to make a transforming humanoid capable of mimicking a user. Team Parinat consists purely of students from various departments of IIT Bombay.\r\n\r\nApart from research, this project would be an asset for areas which are too dangerous (environmentally) for human beings. The major advantage of Parinat being that it can transform into a vehicle state and hence has longer mission times for the same on-board power as rolling has lesser friction opposing it, hence lower power consumption as opposed to walking. However, enabling it to perform most of the tasks a human being is capable of is a complex challenge, and will be achieved over the course of time.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Pictures\r\n![Parinat] (http://technovation.stab-iitb.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ParinatApril-168x300.jpg)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n![Parinat] (http://technovation.stab-iitb.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/DSC_0075.jpg)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Tech Specs \r\n* Degrees of Freedom 12\r\n* Actuators NRS-995 (17kg-cm) \r\n* Microcontroller Arduino Pro Mini \r\n* Power SMPS (5V/25A) \r\n* Material Acrylic\r\n\r\n## Meet the Team \r\n* **Ashay Tejwani** - Founder, Team Leader, Head of IntelX, Simulations, muClub and Motion Mapping \r\n* **Alap Kshirsagar** - Head of Mech-ers \r\n* **Krishnakant Saboo** - Head of IMU \r\n* **Aayush Yadav** - Head of Force Sensors \r\n* **Aman Berlia** - Head of Sonics \r\n* **Goutam Bhat** - Head of Visionaries \r\n* **Nimit Singh** - Head of Elec\r\n\r\n[For contact/ more info, join us here](www.facebook.com/ParinatIITB)","google":"<script>   (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){   (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),   m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)   })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');    ga('create', 'UA-46417000-1', 'technovation.github.io');   ga('send', 'pageview');  </script>","note":"Don't delete this file!
